# SauceDemo Playwright UI Automation Tests

## The goal of the project

This project demonstrates e2e UI test automation of the SauceDemo application using black box testing principles, without access to the application’s internal implementation (white box).

- Prepare test documentation (Test Plan, Test Scenarios, Test Cases, RTM, Risk Analysis etc.)

- Automate critical user flows using Playwright

- Focus on functional testing

- Identify and document functional and UX/UI issues

- Apply test design techniques

## What I Tried to Achieve with This Project

The purpose of this project is not only to automate test scripts, but to demonstrate a realistic approach by combining test automation with helpful testing documentation. I tried to use Playwright as a tool to execute testing decisions, not just as a scripting framework.

## Why This Approach

Many automation projects only execute tests. I tried to test my decision making skills and testing knowledge. Even though the application is a demo, the project was approached as a real-world system in order to create meaningful test coverage and valuable testing documentation.

**Note**: When reviewing the documentation, it may be noticed that many test cases are marked as P1, even though some might typically be considered P2. This prioritization was intentional, as in e-commerce applications even small issues can negatively affect a user’s sense of trust and security. Such issues may lead to user frustration, abandoned purchases, and ultimately impact the company’s reputation and revenue.
